# How to use Volumes of Revolution

## Rendering Solid of Revolution

### Methods

This program supports three methods for volumes of revolution: Disc, Washer, and Shell.

### Axis of Revolution

Choose to rotate around the x axis or the y axis. **Note:** only solids of revolution that revolve about the y axis can be exported.

### Resolution

Resolution is the amount of cylinders per unit used to render the solid of revolution.
The more cylinders used to render the solid of revolution, the better the estimation of the volume of revolution is.

### Bounds of Integration

The boxes labeled "from" and "to" represent the bounds of integration.
For the disc and washer methods, the bounds of integration are along the axis of revolution.
For the shell method, the bounds of integration are distances from the axis of revolution.

### Equation(s)



### Volume

The volume box will show the current estimate of the volume of revolution, based on the volumes of the rendered cylinders.
The more cylinders (higher resolution) used to render the solid of revolution, the better the estimation of the volume of revolution is.

### Color

The color of the rendered solid of revolution can be freely changed. **Note:** that this has no effect on exporting or the color of any 3D prints.

### Title

The title bar is the name of the solid of revolution.
If it is not left empty, the solid of revolution is added to the history queue on the right.

## Exporting and Printing

You can only export solids that revolve about the y axis.
