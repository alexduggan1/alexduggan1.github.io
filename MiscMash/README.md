### Role
For this project, I was the programmer and musician (and various other roles)

### Project Description
Misc Mash is a 2D party fighter where 2-4 players duke it out using an assortment of wacky weapons, curious charms, and bizarre hats.

### My Contributions
For this project, I contributed:

* All of the programming apart from a few item functions (which I created a robust system for my teammates to use to do those few items). This includes:

    * The menu system
    * All player logic
    * The player physics attributes (so that they were easy for my teammate to change)
    * Item distribution system
    * Item pickup system
    * Item usage system
    * Most item functionality
    * Death, damage, and launching
    * Score tracking and moving between scenes
    * Sound effect player system
    * Character animation system
    * and more

* Created bases in unity for basically everything my teammates added into the unity project so they could copy and paste all of the difficult stuff

* All of the music

* Controller support

    * Multiplayer support with dynamic adding and dropping of players
    * Two players on one keyboard (with help from a plugin)
    * Arcade machine support
    * Visual diagram of controls in pause screen

* The credits

* Some UI Art

* Building the game and making some of the itch.io page

* Helped my team learn unity, because none of them had any experience

* Keeping my team organized as well as I could

### Lessons learned
Trying to make up for lackluster effort/contributions for too many teammates for too long is actually detrimental to my physical health.
